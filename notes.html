	<h3>HTML tags</h3>

		<p> 
			HTML tags are used to dictate to the browser how it must display the HTML file. HTML tags are displayed within &lt; &gt; brackets. To close a tag, add the same tag with a forward slash at the end of the command &lt;/  &gt;.

			<br>

			Some tags do not need to be closed. For example, "< br >", which is used to introduce a line break, does not need to be closed. 

			<br>

			Tags should be nested in one another, that is, if you start a tag within another tag, then it should terminated before the encasing tag as well.

	<h3>Git</h3>

	<p>
		Git is a version control system. This means that it keeps track of modifications made to files that are stored in a git repository.

		<br>

		Git also allows you to collaborate with other developers, which means that you can create separate "branches" within a repository for a project that you are working on, so that each branch contains snapshots of modifications made to the project by each developer.

<h2>Lab 2: HTML Knowledge</h2>

<h3>What is an HTML tag? Give three examples of tags</h3>
<p>	
	HTML tags are keywords that define the structure of a webpage, and instruct the browser on how to format and display the page.
	<br>
	Three examples of tags are: &lt;HTML&gt;, &lt;head&gt;, &lt;body&gt;.
</p>

<h3> What is an empty tag? How does it differ from a regular tag? </h3>
<p>
	Empty tags differ from regular tags in the sense that they do not need to enclosed. For example, &lt;br&gt; is a standalone tag that does not need to be closed.
</p>

<h3>What is an attribute of an HTML tag?</h3>
<p>
	Attributes provide additional information about HTML elements. They are added in the opening tag. For example, "lang" is an attribute that is used in the &lt;HTML&gt; tag to declare its language.
		
</p>

<h3> What is the correct way for HTML tags to nest? </h3>
<p>
	If a tag is opened inside another tag, then it cannot be closed after the tag encumbering it has been closed. This would result in an error. The tag must be closed before the enclosing tag is closed.
</p>

<h3> How do you an id to an HTML tag?</h3>
<p>
	An id can be added by including it in the opening tag, and naming it. For example &lt; h1 id = 'head' &gt;. Now this h1 tag has an id called 'head'. In CSS, an id is referred to by adding a hashtag to it. So, 'head' will be referred to in a CSS file as #head.
</p>

<h3>How do you add a class to an HTML tag? </h3>
<p>
	Just like an id, a class is added by typing in its name to the opening tag. In CSS, a class is referred to by adding a period to it.
</p>
	<h3>Why would you use an id vs a class?</h3>
	<p>
		An id is usually used for a particular instance of a tag. On the other hand, a class can be used by multiple elements simultaneously.
	</p>

	<h3>What is a type selector?</h3>
	<p>
		A type selector is used to select and make broad changes to all elements that are of a certain tag type. For example, any attributes changed under type selector p will reflect in all elements within &lt; p &gt;.
	</p>

	<h3>What is the head tag used for? What are some tags that go inside it?</h3>
	<p>
		The head tag is used to include metadata about the html file. Some tags that go inside it are &lt;title&gt; ,&lt;style&gt; , and &lt;link&gt;.
	</p>
	<h3>What is the body tag used for? What are some tags that go inside it?</h3>
	<p>
		The body tag consists of all the elements that are to be displayed in the html file. Examples of tags that are used inside the body tag include &lt;p&gt; , &lt;header&gt; , &lt;div&gt; et cetera.
	</p>

	<h2> Lab 3 : Intro to CSS and the box model </h2>
<div id = 'div1'>
	<h3> Question 1</h3>
	<p>
		The total height and width of this element is 400 x 250. The content height and width is 392 x 242. This is because the box-sizing was set to border-box, which sets the border height and width, and shrinks the content to fit.
	</p>
</div>
<div id = 'div2'>
	<h3> Question 2</h3>
	<p>
		The total height and width of this element is 408 x 258 even though the input height and width were identical with the previous element. This is because the box-sizing was set to content-box, which sets the content height and width and then adds the padding and border accordingly, causing the overall size of the element to increase.
