	<h3>HTML tags</h3>
		<p> HTML tags are used to dictate to the browser how it must display the HTML file. HTML tags are displayed within "< >" brackets. To close a tag, add the same tag with a forward slash at the end of the command "< /  >".
			<br>
			Some tags do not need to be closed. For example, "< br >", which is used to introduce a line break, does not need to be closed. 
			<br>
			Tags should be nested in one another, that is, if you start a tag within another tag, then it should terminated before the encasing tag as well.
