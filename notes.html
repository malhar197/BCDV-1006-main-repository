	<h3>Client/server</h3>

	<h3>HTML tags</h3>

		<p> 
			HTML tags are used to dictate to the browser how it must display the HTML file. HTML tags are displayed within &lt; &gt; brackets. To close a tag, add the same tag with a forward slash at the end of the command &lt;/  &gt;.

			<br>

			Some tags do not need to be closed. For example, "< br >", which is used to introduce a line break, does not need to be closed. 

			<br>

			Tags should be nested in one another, that is, if you start a tag within another tag, then it should terminated before the encasing tag as well.

	<h3>Git</h3>

	<p>
		Git is a version control system. This means that it keeps track of modifications made to files that are stored in a git repository.
		<br>
		Git also allows you to collaborate with other developers, which means that you can create separate "branches" within a repository for a project that you are working on, so that each branch contains snapshots of modifications made to the project by each developer.
